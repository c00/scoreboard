# Scoreboard

A scoreboard for showing the scores of games. Could be used for actual games.

Currently still very much in beta.

The whole project is much more a test project for me to learn Svelte than an attempt at a serious product.

# To do

- [x] Middle Logo size increase. Now same size as other logos.
- [ ] When timer is active and also on 0, buzzer sounds on any change
- [ ] On Clock Switch, remember time left of other clock
- [ ] Enter to apply always
- [ ] Main clock stops: Penalty clock needs to stop as well (Just default to stopping all 3.)
      Maybe even have an overview of all clocks and imediate stop buttons?
- [x] Hot keys for certain actions.
- [ ] themes
- [ ] Sponsors
- [ ] My message
